In particular, the analysis must consider different dynamic networks, highlighting how the dependability metrics change on different networks.

# Define topology
* Open start.ipynb file
* Execute each code block in "Initial stuff" section setting number of hosts
* Execute preferred code block in "Random Topology" or in "Powerlaw Topology"
* Execute code block in "Generate docker-compose file"
* Execute code block in "Docker Compose Up"
* Execute code block in "Start query"
* Execute code block in "Stop container" defining seconds and container's name
